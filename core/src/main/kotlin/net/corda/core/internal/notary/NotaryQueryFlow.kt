 * the notary service and sends the result back to the client.
 *
 * Note that it is expected that the initiating flow is only run on the Notary (i.e.
 * both the initiating flow and this are running on the same system), so we do no
 * checking of the identity of the sender or the integrity of the message. This will
 * need to be revisited if it becomes possible for a Corda node to initiate this flow
 * in future.
